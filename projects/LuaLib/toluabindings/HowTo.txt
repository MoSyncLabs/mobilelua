HOW TO GENERTE LUA BIDNINGS FOR MOSYNC

Note that this is only needed when the MoSync API is 
changed or updated. It is the intention of the MoSync 
team to keep MobileLua in sync with the latest MoSync
release or a recent nightly build.

tolua is used to generate bindings from Lua to MoSync.
Download tolua and build an executable. Download site:
http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~celes/tolua/
You need to download and build Lua before building
tolua. Download Lua from: http://www.lua.org

1. Run the MoSync IDL compiler. 
A header file usable by tolua is created: tools/idl2/Output/lua_maapi.h

2. Copy the lua_maapi.h to directory MobileLua/MobileLuaLib/tolua/ 
in the MobileLua project.

3. Run the Ruby script MobileLua/MobileLuaLib/tolua/makebindings.rb
You will need to update the path to the tolua executable in the
makebindings.rb script.
The script generates an file named lua_maapi.pkg that is then processed 
by tolua to create lua_maapi.c, which contains the Lua bindings.

4. Rebuild project MobileLuaLib in MoSync and the applications that you 
wish to use.

Done.
