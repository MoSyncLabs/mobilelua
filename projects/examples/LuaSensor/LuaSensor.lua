Demo of the accelerometer sensor.
Move the device to change color or the screen.
The result is not that pretty, the app can be improved!

Tested on Android.
]]

-- Start the accelerometer sensor (this sensor has id 1,
-- the second parameter (-1) gives us a medium-high update frequency.
local result = maSensorStart(1, -2)
if 0 ~= result then 
  maPanic(0, "Sensor failed to start") 
end

-- Register sensor listener that draws the screen based
-- on sensor values.
EventMonitor:OnSensor(function(type, x, y, z)
  local red = ((x * 255) / 10) % 255
  local green = (y * 255) % 255
  local blue = (y * 255) % 255
  Screen:SetColor(red, green, blue)
  Screen:Fill()
  Screen:Update()
end)

-- Exit when any key is pressed.
EventMonitor:OnKeyDown(function(keyCode)
  maSensorStop(1)
  EventMonitor:ExitEventLoop()
end)
