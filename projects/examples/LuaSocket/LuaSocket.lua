File: LuaSocket.lua
Author: Mikael Kindborg
Date: 2011-08-18

Program that demonstrates how to use MoSync socket connections from Lua.

This program also shows how to use the "Sys" utility functions to create
C byte buffers and read and write bytes. These functions are listed in
MobileLuaLib/toluabindings/lua_systemapi.h

The support functions that calls back into Lua on connection events
are implemented in MobileLua/lualib/LuaEngine.cpp.

Tested in MoRE and on Android.
